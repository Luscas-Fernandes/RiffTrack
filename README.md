# How to play RiffTrack

Playing RiffTrack is very easy, you just got to run RiffTrack.py.
<br>The minimal requirement is a computer with a camera.

The higher you lift your hands, the higher your instruments will play.
<br>Have fun in your new way of playing your songs!

To play the instruments, you must create a folder named songs at the 
same level as RiffTrack.py. Inside the songs folder, create a directory
for each song, and place the separated instrument tracks inside it:

```plaintext
├─ modules/
│  ├─ GameModule.py
│  ├─ HandTrackingModule.py
├─ songs/
│  ├─ song1/
│  │  ├─ bass.wav
│  │  ├─ drums.wav
│  │  ├─ other.wav
│  │  └─ vocals.wav
│  └─ ... more songs
