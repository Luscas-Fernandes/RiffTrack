# How to play RiffTrack


To play RiffTrack is very easy, you just got to run RiffTrack.py.
The minimal requirement is a computer with a camera.

The higher you lift your hands, the higher your instruments will play.
Have fun in your new way of playing your songs!

## Have no song instruments ?

Try [Split My Track](https://github.com/Luscas-Fernandes/SplitMyTrack), this code 
downloads any song you choose from YouTube and breaks it into four instruments the 
game needs to run.
